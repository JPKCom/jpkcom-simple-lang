/**
 * Guard: the translation catalogue keeps up with the code.
 *
 * Why this exists: the sibling plugins shipped releases whose catalogues had
 * fallen months behind the code, because regenerating was neither automated
 * nor on the release checklist. Every string added in between simply shipped
 * untranslated and nothing said so. This turns that into a red build here
 * before it can happen.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT reimplement `wp i18n make-pot` - CI has no WP-CLI and
 * no WordPress. It extracts only the shape it can read without ambiguity: a
 * single-line call to one of the gettext wrappers whose first argument is a
 * single-quoted literal and whose second argument is this plugin's text domain.
 * Anything it cannot read with certainty it does not report, because a guard
 * that rejects legitimate code is worse than the gap it closes - the gap needs
 * someone to forget, the false positive needs only someone to commit.
 *
 * Consequence of that choice, stated rather than hidden: a string built by
 * concatenation, or spread over several lines, is invisible here. Those exist in
 * this plugin. The guard catches the ordinary case, which is the one that
 * actually happened.

// Since WordPress 6.5 the .l10n.php is the format core loads FIRST. It is not a

// authored directly in it and have no .po at all. Check a file's `x-generator`
// before assuming where it came from.
//
// The two directions are therefore NOT symmetrical:
//
//   .po has a translation the .l10n.php lacks -> FAIL. Core reads the .l10n.php
//     first, so the translation is not being served.
//   .l10n.php has more than the .po           -> legitimate, reported as a NOTE.
//     The danger is not the state but `wp i18n make-php`, which writes the
//     .l10n.php FROM the .po and deletes the difference. That is how the sibling
//     plugin jpkcom-acf-jobs lost 27 German entries in its 1.5.1.
//
// Direction matters: a string translated in the .po and missing from the
// .l10n.php is a build that was not run. A string in the .l10n.php and not in
// the .po is worse - it means the .po is not the source, and the next person to
